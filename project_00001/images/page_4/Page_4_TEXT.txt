The torque of a new generation

Both the 201-hp 1.8L turbo-4 and the 302-hp 3.5L V-6 breathe deeply, rev eagerly and respond in a hurry. A rapid-multispark ignition system fires up to four times in a millisecond. High-pressure Direct Injection micro-manages the fuel spray as quickly as 0.1 millisecond. So their rich torque comes with leaner efficiency and cleaner emissions, too.


Seven close ratios, close at hand

The world's first 7-speed automatic transmission has been reengineered for crisper, more efficient and more responsive performance. Its advanced driver-adaptive logic paces its shifts to suit your current driving style, while standard paddle shifters on the steering wheel let you take charge of gear changes.


Takes curves in stride, takes strides in comfort

The innovative AGILITY CONTROL suspension instantly recalibrates to the road surface, ideally balancing crispness with comfort with every change in the road surface. The lowered and sport-tuned suspension tames corners with an aggressive stance that's appealing even at a standstill.


Great leaps forward in deceleration

Lift off the accelerator quickly and Predictive Brake Priming pre-charges the 4-wheel discs, for more immediate response when you hit the brakes. In the rain, Automatic Brake Drying gently applies the brakes periodically, to sweep away water build-up. During uphill starts, Hill-Start Assist helps prevent unwanted rollback. And a HOLD feature can make stop-and-go traffic a little easier.


Digs into corners, digs out of winter

Optional on the A-Class, 4MATICâ„¢ all-wheel drive integrates our 4-wheel Electronic Traction System.(5) 4-ETS continually redistributes the engine's torque to the wheels with the best grip, even if that's only one wheel. With a 45:55 front/rear torque split, the lightweight and compact 4MATIC system enhances dry-road handling, too.
